As a branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on the bank of West Lake, HIAS has inherited and carried forward CAS's traditional advantage of science and education integration and continued to implement the "One Core and Two Wings" development strategy by building itself into a small yet high-quality institute at a high standard. HIAS aims to vigorously introduce high-level teachers from home and abroad and cultivate high-level sci-tech talent, to meet the needs of the world's sci-tech frontier and the demand for national development. It is also committed to driving in-depth industry-university-research integration through sci-tech innovation and facilitating high-quality regional economy and society.
